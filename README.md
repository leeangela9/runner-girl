# runner-girl

I recently completed a project using the Pygame library, following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&ab_channel=ClearCode). 
The project involved creating a basic infinite runner with a few obstacles, animations, and a scoring system.
I learned a lot about the basics of Pygame, as well as about game design and development.
I am still working on my project and plan to implement more features such as levels and high score.
